# Implementation:

### Libraries in the frontend
To use the backpack design resources:
    "bpk-component-button": "^2.1.57",
    "bpk-component-card": "^1.1.70",
    "bpk-component-grid": "^1.1.126",
    "bpk-component-icon": "^3.27.10",
    "bpk-component-link": "^1.2.56",

To add the spinner while waiting for the results:
    "react-loading": "^2.0.3",

I also increased the versions of react and react-dom to use react hooks:  
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6",
